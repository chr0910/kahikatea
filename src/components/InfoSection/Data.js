    description: "As yet the City Council has not made a memorial for the earthquake victims. When I was in Tokyo for the  fund raising dinner for the Christchurch and Japan earthquake, I had a chat with Mr. Ian Kennedy New Zealand Ambassador in Tokyo about the need to have some form of memorial for the Japanese Students. As a result, I suggested we should make a sculpture for the Japanese, so when the parents come to Christchurch, they have a focal point to remember their lost ones. Funds for the KAHIKATE sculpture we raised in Japan by the Japan Asia-Pacific Ladies Friendship Society. Commissioned by David Bolam-Smith, artist Annabel Menzies-Joyce and lighting designer Kevin Cawley, it was unveiled in Christchurch on the first anniversary of the February 2011 earthquake at an event attended by approximately 100 family members of those died.",
