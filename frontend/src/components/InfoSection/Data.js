    description: "As yet the City Council had not made a memorial for the earthquake victims. When I was in Tokyo attending a fund raising dinner for the Christchurch and Japan earthquake, I had a chat with Mr. Ian Kennedy the then New Zealand Ambassador in Tokyo about the need to have some form of memorial for the Japanese Students. As a result, I suggested we should make a sculpture for the Japanese, so when the parents come to Christchurch, they have a focal point to remember their lost ones. Funds for the KAHIKATE sculpture we raised in Japan by the Japan Asia-Pacific Ladies Friendship Society and Japanese companies. Commissioned by David Bolam-Smith, artist Annabel Menzies-Joyce and lighting designer Kevin Cawley, it was unveiled in Christchurch on the first anniversary of the February 2011 earthquake at an event attended by approximately 100 family members.",
